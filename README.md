# Profit Manager

Profit Manager is a Java-based business management system developed as a first-year Computer Engineering project. It is designed to help small and medium-sized enterprises manage their core business functions, such as inventory, sales, orders, taxes, and employee management. The system allows different user roles (admin, user) to access various features based on their permissions.

## Project Context

This project was created as part of the Computer Engineering curriculum in the first year. It aims to apply object-oriented programming concepts and demonstrate practical skills in Java development while solving real-world business problems.

## Features

- **Inventory Management**: Allows users to track and manage inventory levels, ensuring that stock levels are maintained efficiently.
- **Sales and Purchase Management**: Manages sales and purchase activities, tracking revenues and expenses throughout different periods.
- **Order Management**: Handles customer orders and ensures a smooth workflow for order processing.
- **Tax Calculation**: Calculates yearly taxes based on the total profit, providing important financial insights for businesses.
- **Employee Management**: Enables businesses to manage employee information, including salary and role-based permissions.
- **User Authentication**: Implements a basic authentication system with different roles (e.g., admin, user) that grants access to specific functionalities.
- **Profit and Loss Calculation**: Provides detailed reports on quarterly and yearly profits and calculates income taxes based on company earnings.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used to develop the entire system.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes such as `EmployeeManager`, `InventoryManager`, `OrderManager`, `SalesManager`, `TaxManager`, and `UserManager` are used to encapsulate different business functions and data.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files using a compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) or command line.
3. Run the `Main` class to start the system and interact with the user interface.
4. Log in with predefined users to access the system features.

## Academic Purpose

This project was developed for educational purposes and is intended to demonstrate the application of core programming concepts learned during the first year of the Computer Engineering program.
